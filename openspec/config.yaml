      Optimize for 200k-token AI agents. Each group gets ONE dense task that
      packs all related work into a single checkbox. The agent has enough context
      to figure out the details — don't over-decompose.
    - |
      Use parallel tracks with dependency annotations in group headers:
        ## 1. Track A — short description (parallel with Track B)
        ## 2. Track B — short description (parallel with Track A)
        ## 3. Track C — short description (blocked by Track A + B)
        ## 4. Track D — short description (blocked by Track A + B + C)
      Groups without "blocked by" run concurrently. An orchestrator parses
      these annotations to spawn parallel agents.

      Track letter maps to group number: Track A = group 1, Track B = group 2, etc.
      Use "(parallel with Track X)" for groups that can run at the same time.
      Use "(blocked by Track X + Y)" for groups that depend on prior tracks.
    - Exactly ONE checkbox per group. Combine all related subtasks into a single dense description.
    - Always end with a verification track that runs all tests.
